Enclosed are 2 cap tables for encounter.

gpdk045.basic.CapTbl - is a basic encounter cap table
gpdk045.extended.CapTbl - is an extended cap table created with a pcs file and the coyote field solver

The cap tables take from about 6 min(basic) to 19.5 hours(extended) to run on a Dual-Core Opteron 2.6GHz 4 CPU 8G Memory Linux workstation (/proc/cpuinfo & /proc/meminfo).

Multithread kicks in in the extended cap table generation.

These were built as follows:

First, set up to use SOC81USR1_lnx86

$ generateCapTbl -ict ./gpdk045.ict -output ./gpdk045.basic.CapTbl -basic

$ generateCapTbl -ict ./gpdk045.ict -output ./gpdk045.extended.CapTbl 

=================

Multithread usage:

$ encounter

> setMultiCpuUsage -localCpu max 

> generateCapTbl -ict ./gpdk045.ict -output ./gpdk045.basic.CapTbl -basic

> generateCapTbl -ict ./gpdk045.ict -output ./gpdk045.extended.CapTbl
